# Save Olegator Bot

My friend Olegator was forced to move from his hometown because of war.
While on the road, he had painfully slow internet connection.
That's why I came up with an idea to make a telegram bot that compresses videos
to make them accessible to people with bad internet connection.

I wrote it in few hours without putting much thought in the code, please don't judge.

## Service file

`save-olegator-bot.service` contains an example `systemctl` service file.
Place your own value in the `ExecStart` directive.

## How to run

Create folders: `logs/`, `media/` and install packages from `requirements.txt`.
